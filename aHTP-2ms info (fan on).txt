The averaging has been done for the actual reference altitude of 0 ie the sensor was kept at the same level at all instants of time.


->Average value of N elements = (Average of N-1 elements)*(N-1)/(N).


->Now for a good sensor this value should converge to the static fixed altitude that we have chosen to be 0 in this case.
->But here we see from the data provided that even the average of the readings gradually increase in the magnitude.
->All altitude reading in Centimetres.
